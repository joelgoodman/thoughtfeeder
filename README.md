# THOUGHT FEEDER PODCAST

The [Thought Feeder Podcast](https://thoughtfeederpod.com/) website is going static. We figure there's no point in running this thing on WordPress when our episode files are already stored on Backblaze. Might as well move the site to blazing fast [11ty](https://11ty.dev) on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

## About the show
**Thought Feeder** is a higher education podcast addressing the digital marketing challenges every college and university faces. Often times we question the assumptions of our industry, but we try to balance our critiques and complaints with alternative ways of approaching how higher education does social media and digital marketing.

Give us a listen wherever you get your podcasts and if you can, leave a rating or review on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/thought-feeder/id1503117850).
